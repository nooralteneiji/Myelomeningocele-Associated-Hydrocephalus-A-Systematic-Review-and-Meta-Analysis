# **Management and Outcomes of Myelomeningocele-Associated Hydrocephalus in Low-Income and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis**

This [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/nooralteneiji/Clinical-outcome-in-degenerative-cervical-myelopathy--a-systematic-review/blob/main/Interactive_manuscript.ipynb) presents a comprehensive analysis and review of the management and outcomes of myelomeningocele-associated hydrocephalus in low-income and middle-income countries.

## **Contents:**
1. **Setup**: Environment setup, including the import of necessary libraries and loading of primary datasets.
2. **PRISMA Diagram**: A visual representation of the studies included and excluded during the review process.
3. **Tables and Figures**: Detailed tables and figures that provide a comprehensive overview of studies and their findings.
4. **Supplemental Materials**: Additional insights, including a list of studies excluded at the full-text screening stage and their reasons.

## **Usage:**
The cells do not need to be loaded sequentially to reproduce the results and visualizations, as long as you first run the 'Set-up' code block found at the start of the script.

## **Datasets:**
The [primary dataset](https://github.com/nooralteneiji/Clinical-outcome-in-degenerative-cervical-myelopathy--a-systematic-review/blob/main/Data.xlsx) is organized into multiple sheets, each representing different facets of the study. Each sheet is loaded into its respective DataFrame for analysis.
